# MSU-HoTT-Seminar
A virtual collaborative space for the homotopy type theory seminar group at Montana State University.

This space currently runs on Agda 2.6.2.2 and calls on UniMath for dependencies, in particular its Foundations library. To install UniMath, go to this link: https://github.com/UniMath/agda-unimath, and install UniMath according to its instructions. No need to enable UniMath as a default library, as long as you add the agda-lib file here to your .libraries file.
